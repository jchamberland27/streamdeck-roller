Stream Deck Roller
==================
The plan is to take the original Teal 3d dice roller and:
  - Serve index.html with a Python Flask app to be accessed from a browser
  - Strip out the dice selection UI from the HTML
  - Duplicate the original dice UI functionality using API endpoints to build rolling parameters:
    - ADD - adds to the current roll's parameters
    - CLEAR - Deletes the current roll's parameters
    - ROLL - Sends the current roll to the front end to be rendered
  - Access the API to control the roller via Stream Deck using the Bar Raiders API ninja plugin:

Original Readme
